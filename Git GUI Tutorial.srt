00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
hello and welcome everybody I margin and
today we're going to be doing a tutorial

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:14,70
on how to manage a remote and local
repository using get Dewey now get is

3
00:00:14,70 --> 00:00:20,310
just a simple program that allows you to
manage all your paws Tory's the gooey

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,140
factor of it is simply a graphical user
interface that it makes it quite simple

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,160
to use compared to using the command
line so the first thing we're going to

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,790
want to do is set up our remote
repository and to do that you're going

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,290
to need need to create an account with
the bit bucket for this you can go to

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,10
bitbucket org all the links in this
video will be in the description also

9
00:00:41,10 --> 00:00:45,629
there's a link there to that you simply
just put the username email and password

10
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,780
it's a free side once you've done that
you can log in and you're going to come

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,440
into a to a page similar to this this is
your dashboard as you can see here I

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,920
have four repositories currently on my
account that i am working on but what

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,430
you're going to do to create a new
repository is going to go over here to

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,229
create and you're just going to click
there it's gonna bring you to screen

15
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,179
like this what you're going to do now is
enter a name for your repository you can

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,770
see I have a couple from the past here
we're just going to name this one get

17
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,539
tutorial before I can spell that'd be
great

18
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,799
I used through a quick description in
there if you'd like so we're going to

19
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,900
say how to use get if you click this
here I all it does is affect whether

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,770
someone needs to put in a password or
not to work with the remote people also

21
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,729
we are going to leave this on just so
that only we can allow people to user

22
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,960
repository if they have the password
again the other settings here you will

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,369
not have to worry about

24
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,909
we're just doing a simple explanation
how to use get so it is not that

25
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,180
important here in language you can
choose which codebase you're using that

26
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,990
there's a long list of different things
you can use you do not have to select

27
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,979
one but it is helpful and it will help
you when you're working on bitbucket

28
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,520
here so we're just gonna go ahead and
select Ravitz a codebase i usually

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,519
working but feel free to use what ever
you are using

30
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:17,20
and then just go ahead and click create
repository and here you are you're at

31
00:02:17,20 --> 00:02:22,840
the dashboard of your get tutorial but
as you can see there's nothing here we

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,980
go to our source

33
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,980
nothing is here it's asking us to our
first commit it's just an empty

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,929
repository it's just there it's set up
so that we can use it now so we're going

35
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,260
to do all we need to do using Google's
going to hear click i have an existing

36
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,130
project and this URL right here is what
you're going to want to use okay all

37
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:49,210
this is https colon slash slash your
username at bucket . org slash your user

38
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:57,220
name / title of the repository place any
spaces with ashes . get ok but if you

39
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,370
just go right here you'll be able to
access that very easily and so now we

40
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:09,970
are done with bitbucket . work we're
going to go ahead and download get going

41
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,200
to want to go to get dash

42
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,600
scmp.com this is the homepage forget and
as you can see here just on the right

43
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,60
side there is a download for windows

44
00:03:22,60 --> 00:03:25,209
as well as Mac we're going to do windows

45
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,320

downloading it's right there on my
desktop you're going to want to go ahead

48
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:45,820
and double click that and it's going to
bring up the install page for first you

49
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,530

hit run and if you get any other ones

50
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,790
just hit yes and it's gonna bring up the
setup wizard here so all you need to do

51
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,799
on the screen is hit next and next again
here you the only you need to make sure

52
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,610
that's changed is that additional icons
is selected all that's going to do is

53
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,970
toss the shortcut on your desktop and
click Launch so it's easier to access

54
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,60
then you're going to hit next until we
get all the way through don't have to

55
00:04:10,60 --> 00:04:13,750
worry about in these things and we'll
just wait for the install to finish here

56
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,640
right now we're going to uncheck view
release notes it's not necessary that

57
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,108
you view them if you do have a reason
for you

58
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:24,469
absolutely of the power to but we're
just going to go ahead and skip that for

59
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:29,539
now I was going to do is you're going to
get to get gooey the shortcut on your

60
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:34,68
desktop just pull over the git bash one
here as well so these are the two that

61
00:04:34,69 --> 00:04:35,840
are going to show up on your desktop

62
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,508
we're not going to get bachelors put
that away for now we're just going to

63
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:41,870
stick with gooeys it's easier to
understand and much easier to work with

64
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,39
go ahead and double-click that on this
page will open up here this is the

65
00:04:46,39 --> 00:04:50,000
google homepage you have three options
create a new repository which is going

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,360
to create a local repository on this
computer

67
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,509
the second option is clone an existing
repository and once I what that will do

68
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,80
is clone a relative repository from
another location whether it be remote or

69
00:05:03,80 --> 00:05:06,740
locally so that's good for if you have
other people that would like to use your

70
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,520
programmer sorry out that would like to
use your repository they'll be able to

71
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,479
clone it and work on and on their
machine and open existing repository was

72
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,90
to open a repository that you have
stored on your computer

73
00:05:17,90 --> 00:05:20,659
generally if you've already open them
you'll have an open recent repository

74
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:24,889
which is much easier to use usually just
click on that brings me to my repository

75
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:30,440
saves me a little bit of time so the
first thing we need to do is we're going

76
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:37,729
to create a new repository so we have a
remote repository here on bitbucket but

77
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:40,190
no way is that connected yet to our
computer

78
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:47,930
ok so we're going to first create a new
repository and we're going to put choose

79
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,569
the director that goes in just so for
ease of access here we're going to put

80
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:57,500
it on the desktop so we're just going to
go ahead and select

81
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:01,830
whoops we're going to actually go up
here to desktop select desktop

82
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,830
ok it's going to put in the directory
first we're actually just going to add a

83
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,998
new folder named they're also not having
this is not splattered with us up so

84
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:17,249
we'll call it get tutorial and just go
ahead and create our click create in

85
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:20,999
here is the screen for your repository
to be easily be resized to whatever you

86
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:26,669
need to be in here let me just drag the
folder here there's the folder that we

87
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,839
just created understand my second
daughter here so if we open that up

88
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,119
there it is

89
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:37,889
you can see that there's a hidden folder
called . get this is the folder that it

90
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:42,749
uses to understand all the changes and
work with your repository so that's how

91
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:46,979
you know it's your local repository
there now that we have our local

92
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:51,209
repository we're going to want to
connect that the remote repository so

93
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:55,110
we're going to do is we're going to the
remote tab here we're gonna add

94
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:01,949
selection so you can choose a name the
name is not Todd does not truly matter

95
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:05,819
too much so if you want you can use a
descriptive name such as tutorial remote

96
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:12,59
location or mota repo but generally what
I just go with is I just name it

97
00:07:12,59 --> 00:07:15,599
origin I'd simple and I know that that's
where it's coming from and then the

98
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,669
location you're going to put that URL
for the remote repository that was the

99
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:24,628
one we got off this page right here just
go ahead and grab that you just copy it

100
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:31,79
and you're going to go ahead and paste
it right there in the location and

101
00:07:31,79 --> 00:07:35,759
simply have to click Add what it's going
to do the fetch immediately just means

102
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,409
it's going to fetch from it right away

103
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:42,89
nothing there's that's fine so just add
it you're going to get this little

104
00:07:42,89 --> 00:07:44,699
screen here it will prompt you for a
password

105
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,729
just toss in the password you use to set
up your account that's what it's gonna

106
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:52,79
be prompting you for and then it's going
to show you that six success which means

107
00:07:52,79 --> 00:07:55,000
we are now connected

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,810
ok now our repositories are connected so
we're going to go ahead and we're going

109
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,740
to create a new file in here as if
you're working in our repository so

110
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,730
we're going to create our readme file to
the first file you create groups made a

111
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:14,350
bit of a spelling mistake then we fix
that perfect go in and we're going to

112
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:24,160
say okay I'm get tutorial perfect to
save up the file close it down now we

113
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,610
have a new file so now what we have to
do is you have to make sure that the

114
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,850
that get knows that's there so we're
going to do is you're going to click

115
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,200
rescan going to check for any files that
have been changed since the last commit

116
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,90
so you can see the readme file is there
but now we're going to want to stage

117
00:08:40,90 --> 00:08:44,500
those files so that we can commit them
so it's going to ask you to stage one on

118
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,370
track file

119
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,550
yes we do want to do that now you're
gonna say it's in the stage that's

120
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,770
what's gonna be committed if you hit
commit a crime so next they want to do

121
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,710
is you always in a message with your
commit so I always click sign off here

122
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,690
and what that does it's going to sound
show that it's signed off by so-and-so

123
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,400
with such an email so i just change that
to my name and my email and we're also

124
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,930
going to toss a message in there that
says we added the readme file okay just

125
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,500
so if anyone else looking at repository
they know what we did on this commit and

126
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,620
then you simply hit commit and welcome
it does is that's going to commit

127
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:23,680
locally on the computer so it saved
locally on the repository the next thing

128
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,329
we need to do now is we need that now
need to change it on the remote

129
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:34,839
repository so if we go look locally it's
there but if we go to remote and we go

130
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,440
to our source tab here you're going to
see that it's still empty

131
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:49,000
okay so we need to go ahead and push
that up to the remote repository so go

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,470
ahead and hit click push going to see
whatever branch you're working on more

133
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:59,110
work on master so select that USA which
destinations going to its remote origins

134
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,310
what we need that before

135
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,479
if you have more to be shown there and
then you're just going to go ahead and

136
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,839
click push it's going to prompt you for
the password

137
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,300
so go ahead and type in the same
password you use for your account again

138
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,900
and there you go you can see the
successful show you what's been pushed

139
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:21,380
up 422 bites of the file and that's
always pushed wonderful success now we

140
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,300
just go ahead and close that wonderful
and now if we go ahead and refresh

141
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,99
refresh the remote repository here you
can see there's our there's a readme

142
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,460
file and that's the information that's
in it

143
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,270
we're just going to go ahead and change
it here so we're going to go ahead and

144
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:44,510
just put the point 01 you can just
change some things through dad bitbucket

145
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,110
so we're going to commit that so that
things have been changed and it's going

146
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,190

there's been a change there now what we

152
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,10
need to do is if you look here nothing's
changed

153
00:11:25,10 --> 00:11:28,100
this is because we've just finished the
changes we haven't applied them to our

154
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,870
local repository to do that you're going
to do emerge you want to stretch to and

155
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,680
want to go into local emergency origin
master we're going to want to merge that

156
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,620
so what that's going to do is it's going
to apply the changes to our local

157
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,550
repository that you can see the changes
there and it was a success

158
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,620
so now if we go down into get tutorial
here open up and open the remaining

159
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,590
they're going to see it's changed to be
. all one so what we're going to do next

160
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:59,570
here is we're going to clone an existing
repository so anyone working on your

161
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,600
project that needs repository and their
computers going to select this here

162
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,230
clone existing repository you're going
to choose the source location again

163
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:13,760
where you want to store that repository
so we can just go ahead and select our

164
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,689
remote repository location that we had
before such as where the repos coming

165
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,290
from can be a local location as well but
you're going to give your

166
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,529
multiplication of someone they'll put it
in there and then we're going to select

167
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:27,500
our desktop again for our target
directory which is where it's going to

168
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,649
go and we're going to call it get
tutorial to come and then you just hit

169
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:39,19
clone it's going to take a second here
it's going to prompt you for three sets

170
00:12:39,19 --> 00:12:43,9
of passwords all the same password you
just have to do it a couple times here

171
00:12:43,9 --> 00:12:51,19
there's the second one and finally the
third one here and then we're going to

172
00:12:51,19 --> 00:12:55,160
come up with our get tutorial too and
it's not going to be set up on the

173
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,850
desktop under the firearms of the file
folder to get tutorial to just pull it

174
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,360
over here

175
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,360
there it is and there's the readme file
as we changed it before up on the remote

176
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,860
repository wonderful so we're just going
to create a new file here that we are

177
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,279
just working on and decide that we don't
want to put on a more positive even

178
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,759
called error . text I'm just gonna put
some random order to submit which closed

179
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,300
that down and we're gonna save it
wonderful

180
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,500
so Eric text now if we reschedule we're
going to see that that's something we

181
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,40
don't want on our repository we've made
an error so what you're going to do is

182
00:13:31,40 --> 00:13:36,829
going to stage that change anything in
the green here I is what can be reset

183
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:39,649
what can be deleted so if you need to
eat some you go ahead and staged it

184
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:46,130
you're going to go to branch and reset
the branch reset you can see everything

185
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,120
that was in the green there is removed
you have to stage first also want to

186
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,60
leave it if we go back into our tutorial
here you're going to see that file is no

187
00:13:53,60 --> 00:13:58,339
longer there so it's been reset so let's
say you're working on a code file and

188
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:02,690
you add 10 20 lines of code you realize
you made a mistake you can simply rescan

189
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:07,459
stage and then reset and that's going to
raise only the lines of code you changed

190
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:10,638
that's going to help you with your
project

191
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:15,740
ok on PEEP pocket here there's a few
useful things you can see the commits

192
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,9
what we've done you see which one to
commit so far we've added the readme

193
00:14:19,9 --> 00:14:24,79
file and edit it online using the pocket
and commit to anyone you'll be able to

194
00:14:24,79 --> 00:14:28,638

they left with it as well as you can
